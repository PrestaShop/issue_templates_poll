# PrestaShop Issue Templates Poll

This repository aims to present GitHub issue templates to be submitted to the
PrestaShop community for a vote.

The templates found here serve as a **base** for standardizing issue reporting.
However, they are designed to be adaptable based on specific repository needs.

## Adaptability

While these templates provide a common structure, they can be declined or
extended depending on the project. Please note that the following points are
just **examples** of possible customizations and **not a final list**:

- **Themes**: A "Theme Version" field could be added.
- **AutoUpgrade Module**: Specific fields like "PrestaShop version from" and
  "PrestaShop version to" would be included.

The goal is to validate the core structure with the community before rolling
them out (with necessary adaptations) across various PrestaShop repositories.
